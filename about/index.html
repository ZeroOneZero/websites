          <p class="fancybox"><img alt="" class="center" src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" style="float:left;width:30%;">
          <h3>I have devoted the last 17 years to computers. They have influenced the world in so many ways. Sometimes I wonder if we as a
            civilization could manage without them. Technology has changed so much since I first understood there was such a things as a micro-processor. Keeping up with the times is
            a full time job, not to mention trying to gain any ground in this field.</h3>
            
          <h3>For 3 years I served in the US Army, in a Air Defense unit. I gained an unmeasurable amount of information and skill, in a great many subjects. After I was employed by
            Northrop Grumman, a company notorious for government contracts. After 4 years I was feed up with the corporate world. There was never enough sh** paper to wipe up all the
            bull. It was then I decided to use my skills not for "the man", but for the average person. I have listed here and there my different qualifications but do not believe
            what you read, simply reach out to me email, text etc… and find out for yourself.</h3>

          <h3>I have no set rate for services. I believe every job has its own requirement therefore must require a unique bill. A bill which we will work out. I do not adhere to any
            corporate standard rate. I perform services ranging from consultation to complete business network overhaul. I have yet to come across something that I "could not" do.
            That phrase is not in my vocabulary.</h3>
          <h3>My two children are at the forefront of why I work so hard, although that in itself can take away from the very thing I am trying to do, provide them with the best life
            has to offer. So I work non-stop, sometimes maybe too much. Many a battles I have lost, good will prevail and the war…. well that just getting started!</h3>

		<h3>Research and Development or RND is my forte. I've blown through so many different projects it's unreal.</h3>

          <h2>Why start your own company</h2>
          <h3>Good question, I started this company due to outrageous prices and illiterate people. I am here to provide a service not to
            take your money and run. This is my life, passion, hobby... In order to have a good business you must do good business. If you were wondering the "1&amp;0" is a play on
            words because computers operate via a Binary Number system that requires a simple yet complex set of 1's and 0's. Although you cannot see them, they are there.</h3>
          <br>
          <h2>I'll tell you a story... once upon a time,</h2>
          <h3>There are some "Computer Repair" shops that I or a customer have taken items to in the past and you would be surprised at the
            hidden fees. For example, if you were to say take a computer that wouldn't turn on to someone you could be charged a fee for "them" to examine it; if they couldn't
            diagnose it there would be a second fee to ship it to a 3rd party, the 3rd party would tax a third fee, MAYBE fix it, and finally a fourth fee to ship it back. When it
            arrives back at your local "Computer Repair" shop a week or two later they tell you "Sorry there was nothing I could do." Now it is still broken and you are out $200! That
            is outrageous and one of the main reasons I started this company.</h3>
