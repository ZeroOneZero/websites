                            <h1 style="">About Me</h1>
							<h2>Robert Adams Jr<br>Owner of 1&amp;0 Computer Care</h2>

                            <p>I have devoted the last 17 years to computers. They have influenced the world in so many ways. Sometimes I wonder if we as a civilization could manage without
                                them.</p>

                                <p>Technology has changed so much since I first understood there was such a things as a micro-processor. Keeping up with the times is a full time job, not to mention
                                trying to gain any ground in this field.</p>


                                <p>For 3 years I served in the US Army, in a Air Defense unit. I gained an unmeasurable amount of information and skill, in a great many subjects.</p>

                                <p>After I was employed by Northrop Grumman, a company notorious for government contracts. After 4 years I was feed up with the corporate world. There was never enough
                                sh** paper to wipe up all the bull. It was then I decided to use my skills not for "the man", but for the average person. I have listed here and there my different
                                qualifications but do not believe what you read, simply reach out to me email, text etc… and find out for yourself.</p>

                                <p>I have no set rate for services. I believe every job has its own requirement therefore must require a unique bill. A bill which we will work out. I do not adhere to
                                any corporate standard rate. I perform services ranging from consultation to complete business network overhaul.</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <p>I have yet to come across something that I "could not" do. That phrase is not in my vocabulary.</p>

                                <p>My two children are at the forefront of why I work so hard, although that in itself can take away from the very thing I am trying to do, provide them with the best
                                life has to offer. So I work non-stop, sometimes maybe too much. Many a battles I have lost, good will prevail and the war…. well that just getting started!</p>

                                <p>Research and Development or RND is my forte. I've blown through so many different projects it's unreal. Below is a list of the ones that come to mind.</p>

                                <p>If you are interested contact me, below is additional information.</p>

                                <p>I am the owner of 1&amp;0 Computer Care. The "1&amp;0" is a play on words because computers operate via a Binary Number system that requires a simple yet
                                complex set of 1's and 0's. Although you cannot see them, they are there.</p>

                                <p>Along with my work I am also enrolled in College working on my Computer Security Degree. Serving in the US Army for three years afforded me the opportunity to
                                continue my education even after I served my time.</p>


                                <p style="font-size: 24pt; font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: bold; line-height: 100%;">Why start your own company</p>


                                <p>Good question, I started this company due to outrageous prices and illiterate people. I am here to provide a service not to take your money and run. This is my
                                life, passion, hobby... In order to have a good business you must do good business.</p>


                                <h3>I'll tell you a story... once upon a time,</h3>


                                <p>There are some "Computer Repair" shops that I or a customer have taken items to in the past and you would be surprised at the hidden fees. For example, if
                                you were to say take a computer that wouldn't turn on to someone you could be charged a fee for "them" to examine it; if they couldn't diagnose it there
                                would be a second fee to ship it to a 3rd party, the 3rd party would tax a third fee, MAYBE fix it, and finally a fourth fee to ship it back. When it arrives back at
                                your local "Computer Repair" shop a week or two later they tell you "Sorry there was nothing I could do." Now it is still broken and you are out
                                $200! That is outrageous and one of the main reasons I started this company.</p>
